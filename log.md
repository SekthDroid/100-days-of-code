### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on new content to start blogging again.

**Thoughts:** It's not code after all, but for me its a simple start after 5 days of vacation.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I have created a new Android project and prepared some doc with the League of Legends API reference I need.

**Thoughts:** It's a little step, but it's something!.


### Day 3: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a sample app to learn about Android integration with Beacons.

**Thoughts:** It has been a good experience, and I have learned a lot about Bluetooth handling in Android, and what I need to have in mind about battery life.
