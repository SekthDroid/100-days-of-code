### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on new content to start blogging again.

**Thoughts:** It's not code after all, but for me its a simple start after 5 days of vacation.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I have created a new Android project and prepared some doc with the League of Legends API reference I need.

**Thoughts:** It's a little step, but it's something!.


### Day 3: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a sample app to learn about Android integration with Beacons.

**Thoughts:** It has been a good experience, and I have learned a lot about Bluetooth handling in Android, and what I need to have in mind about battery life.


### Day 4: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Implemented some cache system for one of my pet projects using TDD.

**Thoughts:** It has been so slow for me, but the confidence of all tests passing is a wonderful feedback about the system. Im in love with TDD.

### Day 5: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed some bugs in one of my pet projects.

**Thoughts:** This was a bug that I didnt know about, but its clearly my fault, no tests with the given case, so i didnt know about it.
